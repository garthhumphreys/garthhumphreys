### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on:
- [HakPad](https://github.com/garthhumphreys/hakpad) (Note-taking app for hacking, bug bounty and security assessments) and;
- [HealthWatch](https://www.healthwatch.ky/) (web app that monitors the public health status of the Cayman Islands)

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Vuejs
- Nuxtjs
- Electronjs

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Security tools ([HakPad](https://github.com/garthhumphreys/hakpad)), Music Production tools or Health/Medicine tools ([HealthWatch](https://www.healthwatch.ky/))

🤔 I’m looking for help with development on [HakPad](https://github.com/garthhumphreys/hakpad) and [HealthWatch](https://www.healthwatch.ky/)

💬 Ask me about web development, football (FC Barcelona) and music production (https://garthhumphreysmusic.com/ and https://www.beatstars.com/garthhumphreysmusic/feed)

📫 How to reach me: [@garthhumphreys](https://twitter.com/garthhumphreys) or [garthhumphreys@gmail.com](mailto:garthhumphreys@gmail.com)
