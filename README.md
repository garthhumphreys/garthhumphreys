### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on:
- [HakPad](https://hakpad.io) (Note-taking app for hacking, bug bounty and security assessments) (submit your feature requests [here](https://github.com/garthhumphreys/hakpad-feature-requests)) and;
- [HealthWatch](https://www.healthwatch.ky/) (web app that monitors the public health status of the Cayman Islands)

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Vuejs
- Nuxtjs
- Electronjs

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Security tools ([HakPad](https://hakpad.io)), Music Production tools or Health/Medicine tools ([HealthWatch](https://www.healthwatch.ky/))

🤔 I’m looking for help with development on [HakPad](https://hakpad.io) and [HealthWatch](https://www.healthwatch.ky/)

💬 Ask me about web development (https://garthhumphreys.com), football (FC Barcelona) and music production (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYQb0P7YckJoqIrTVm411-w)
